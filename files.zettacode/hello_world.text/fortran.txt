Simplest case - display using default formatting:

print *,"Hello world!"

Use explicit output format:

100   format (5X,A,"!")
      print 100,"Hello world!"

Output to channels other than stdout goes like this:

write (89,100) "Hello world!"

uses the format given at label 100 to output to unit 89. If output unit with this number exists yet (no "<tt>OPEN</tt>" statement or processor-specific external unit setting), a new file will be created and the output sent there. On most UNIX/Linux systems that file will be named "<tt>fort.89</tt>".
