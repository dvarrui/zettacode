<!-- {{incorrect|Applesoft BASIC|output isn't consistent with the task's requirements: mixed case.}} -->

Important Note: Although Applesoft BASIC allowed the storage and output of mixed-case strings, the ability to enter mixed-case via the keyboard and to output mixed-case on the default display was not offered as standard equipment on the original Apple II/II+.  Since Applesoft WAS the default programming language for the Apple II+, perhaps some flexibility in the task specification could be offered, for this and for other systems that lacked proper mixed-case I/O capabilities in at least one popular configuration.
