	program-id. hello.
	procedure division.
		display "Hello world!".
		stop run.

Using relaxed compilation rules, the hello program can become a single DISPLAY statement.

display"Hello, world".

prompt$ cobc -x -frelax-syntax -free hello.cob

hello.cob: 1: Warning: PROCEDURE DIVISION header missing - assumed

prompt$ ./hello
Hello, world

''Note how COBOL can handle the DISPLAY reserved word without a space before the quoted string, the quote being a compile time scan delimiter.  The full stop period after the single statement is still mandatory, at least for GnuCOBOL and a clean compile to executable.''
