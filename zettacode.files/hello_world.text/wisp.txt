Output in Wisp follows the same concepts as [[Scheme]], but replacing outer parentheses with indentation.

With [[Guile]] and wisp installed, this example can be tested in a REPL started with guile --language=wisp, or directly with the command wisp.

import : scheme base
         scheme write
display "Hello world!"
newline
