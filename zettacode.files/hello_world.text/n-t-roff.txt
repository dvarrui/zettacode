To get text output, compile the source file using NROFF and set output to the text terminal.  If you compile using TROFF, you will get graphical output suitable for typesetting on a graphical typesetter/printer instead.

Because /.ROFF/ is a document formatting language, the majority of input is expected to be text to output onto a medium.  Therefore, there are no routines to explicitly call to print text.
