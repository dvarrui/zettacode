to operate :a :b
  (print [a =] :a)
  (print [b =] :b)
  (print [a + b =] :a + :b)
  (print [a - b =] :a - :b)
  (print [a * b =] :a * :b)
  (print [a / b =] int :a / :b)
  (print [a mod b =] modulo :a :b)
end

Each infix operator also has a prefix synonym (sum, difference, product, quotient). Sum and product can also have arity greater than two when used in parentheses (sum 1 2 3). Infix operators in general have high precedence; you may need to enclose their arguments in parentheses to obtain the correct expression.
