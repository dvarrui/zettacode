These operations are all built-in.  As all operations are exact, there are no rounding issues involved.

DoIt := proc()
        local a := readstat( "Input an integer: " ):
        local b := readstat( "Input another integer: " ):
        printf( "Sum = %d\n",  a + b ):
        printf( "Difference = %d\n",  a - b ):
        printf( "Product = %d\n",  a * b ):
        printf( "Quotient = %d\n",  iquo( a, b, 'c' ) ):
        printf( "Remainder = %d\n", c ); # or irem( a, b )
        NULL # quiet return
end proc:

Here is an example of calling DoIt.

> DoIt();
Input an integer: 15;
Input another integer: 12;
Sum = 27
Difference = 3
Product = 180
Quotient = 1
Remainder = 3
