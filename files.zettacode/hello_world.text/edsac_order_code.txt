The EDSAC did not support lower-case letters. The method used here is to include a separate <code>O</code> order to print each character: for short messages and labels this is quite adequate. A more general (though slightly more involved) solution for printing strings is given at [[Hello world/Line printer#EDSAC order code]].
[ Print HELLO WORLD ]

O13@  [ Each O order outputs one ]
O14@  [ character. The numerical ]
O15@  [ parameter gives the offset ]
O16@  [ (from the base address) where ]
