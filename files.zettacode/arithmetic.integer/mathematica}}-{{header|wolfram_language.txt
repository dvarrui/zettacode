Mathematica has all the function built-in to handle this task. Example:
a = Input["Give me an integer please!"];
b = Input["Give me another integer please!"];
Print["You gave me ", a, " and ", b];
Print["sum: ", a + b];
Print["difference: ", a - b];
Print["product: ", a b];
Print["integer quotient: ", Quotient[a, b]];
Print["remainder: ", Mod[a, b]];
Print["exponentiation: ", a^b];
gives back for input 17 and 3:
You gave me 17 and 3
sum: 20
difference: 14
product: 51
integer quotient: 5
remainder: 2
exponentiation: 4913
