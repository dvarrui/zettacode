Code is called as a subroutine (i.e. JSR Arithmetic).  Specific OS/hardware routines for user input and printing are left unimplemented.
Arithmetic:	PHA			;push accumulator and X register onto stack
		TXA
		PHA
		JSR GetUserInput	;routine not implemented
		;two integers now in memory locations A and B
		;addition
		LDA A
		CLC
		ADC B
		JSR DisplayAddition	;routine not implemented

		;subtraction
		LDA A
		SEC
		SBC B
		JSR DisplaySubtraction	;routine not implemented

		;multiplication - overflow not handled
		LDA A
		LDX B
Multiply:	CLC
		ADC A
		DEX
		BNE Multiply
		JSR DisplayMultiply	;routine not implemented

		;division	- rounds up
		LDA A
		LDX #0
		SEC
Divide:		INX
		SBC B
		BCS Divide
		TXA			;get result into accumulator
		JSR DisplayDivide	;routine not implemented

		;modulus
		LDA A
		SEC
Modulus:	SBC B
		BCS Modulus
		ADC B
		JSR DisplayModulus	;routine not implemented

		PLA			;restore accumulator and X register from stack
		TAX
		PLA
		RTS			;return from subroutine
The 6502 has no opcodes for multiplication, division, or modulus; the routines for multiplication, division, and modulus given above can be heavily optimized at the expense of some clarity.
