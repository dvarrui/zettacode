Numbers are automatically converted to accomodate for the result. This means not only that Int32 will be expanded to Int64 but also that a non-integer quotient will cause the result to be of a floating-point type.

The remainder has the sign of the first operand.

No exponentiation operator exists, but can be worked around with the .NET BCL:
[Math]::Pow($a, $b)
