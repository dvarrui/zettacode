Input and output would be OS-specific and are not implemented. This routine works on the 16-bit 8086, as well as on its 32-bit and 64-bit successors: it could be trivially modified to perform 32-bit or 64-bit arithmetic on machines where those are supported. The quotient is truncated towards zero; the remainder takes its sign from the first operand.
